This is an attempt to pull the library from Khan Academy to handy iPhone and users can watch / download videos directly to it. The project is developed using Titanium Appcelerator Mobile SDK.

The playlist/videos info were retrieved and stored as JSON locally as of Februray 1st, 2012 in order to save time pulling the list from the server. A mechanism to update this playlist will be added.

This project does not use any 3rd modules so hopefully you can easily pull it down and use as it is.   

Quote from Khan Academy:
The Khan Academy is an organization on a mission. We're a not-for-profit with the goal of changing education for the better by providing a free world-class education to anyone anywhere.
